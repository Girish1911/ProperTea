Real Estate Listing Platform
Welcome to the Real Estate Listing Platform! This project is a full-stack application designed to showcase real estate listings with a modern, Apple-inspired user interface. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and plain JavaScript, while the backend is powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

Features
Stunning UI: A clean, elegant, and interactive user interface inspired by Apple's design principles.

Dynamic Listings: Property cards are dynamically loaded and displayed from the backend.

User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login functionality.

Search Functionality: Filter listings by keyword or location.

Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and looks great on all devices.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You'll need the following software installed:

Node.js (which includes npm)

MongoDB (either a local instance or a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas)

A code editor like VS Code

1. Clone the Repository
First, download the project from GitHub and navigate to the project directory.

# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repository-url>

# Navigate to the project folder
cd <your-project-name>

Backend Setup
The backend is an Express.js server that connects to a MongoDB database.

Install Dependencies and Run the Server
From the backend directory, install all the required Node.js packages and then start the server.

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start

Your backend server will now be running on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup
The frontend is a static site. You do not need a separate server to run it.

1. Open the Project
Navigate to the frontend folder and open the index.html file using a live server extension in your code editor.

Alternatively, you can simply double-click the index.html file to open it in your browser, but a live server is recommended for a better development experience.

You are now ready to use the application! You can browse properties, sign up for a new account, and add your own listings.
